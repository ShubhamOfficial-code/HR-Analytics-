# HR Analytics Project: Predicting Candidate Reneges in Talent Acquisition

## Overview

This project focuses on **ScaleneWorks**, a Bangalore-based startup founded in 2010 by Sanjay Shelvankar, Ashish Tiwari, and Sharon George. ScaleneWorks specializes in delivering innovative talent acquisition solutions, aiming to transform how businesses approach hiring in today’s dynamic environment. Their expertise lies in optimizing business processes by enhancing employee skills, improving process efficiency, and leveraging new technologies.

The business scenario revolves around a critical challenge faced by ScaleneWorks and its clients: managing a high-quality workforce in an industry with notoriously high employee turnover. A significant issue identified is **"renege"**—where candidates accept job offers but fail to join the company. This problem leads to wasted resources, increased recruitment costs, and potential compromises in resource quality.

The primary goal of this project is to investigate the feasibility of using **predictive analytics** to develop a model that can anticipate whether a candidate will both accept a job offer and join the company. By addressing this challenge, ScaleneWorks aims to reduce recruitment costs, improve resource allocation, and enhance client satisfaction.

## Business Problem

### Key Challenges:
1. **High Employee Turnover**: The industry faces significant challenges in retaining talent, leading to frequent reneges.
2. **Resource Wastage**: Reneges result in wasted time, money, and effort invested in recruitment.
3. **Client Impact**: Clients issuing thousands of job offers annually face increased costs and potential compromises in resource quality due to reneges.

### Objectives:
- Develop a predictive model to identify candidates likely to renege after accepting a job offer.
- Reduce recruitment costs and improve resource allocation.
- Enhance client satisfaction by minimizing renege cases.

## Methodology

This project employs a **data-driven approach** to build a predictive model. The methodology includes:

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Analyze the provided dataset, which includes historical data on candidate profiles, job offers, and renege cases.
   - Explore features such as candidate demographics, job role, offer details, and communication history.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Perform feature engineering to create meaningful predictors.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze patterns and trends in renege cases.
   - Identify key factors influencing candidate decisions.

4. **Model Development**:
   - Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to build predictive models.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Model Deployment**:
   - Deploy the best-performing model to predict renege cases in real-time.
   - Provide actionable insights to recruiters and hiring managers.
